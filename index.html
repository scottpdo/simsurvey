      <h2>What's going on here?</h2>

      <p>This is a visualization of the results of a <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/kAnEPLvxocJJaMOy2">3-question survey</a> on computer simulations. The goal is to gain some insight into how people think about computer simulations. This is not a very scientific survey, nor is it IRB-approved! So, that's just to say &mdash; take this all with a shaker of salt. Anyway, the survey asks:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>What is a simulation?</li>
        <li>Is it possible for a simulation to precisely and accurately model reality?</li>
        <li>Do you believe we are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis">living in a simulation</a>?</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Findings</h2>

      <p>As of <i>December 2, 2017</i>, 60 people have taken the survey. Of those:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>About <b>half (51.7%)</b> of the respondents answered between 6 and 8 on the ability of simulations to model reality.</li>
        <li>About <b>half (53.3%)</b> of the respondents think there is a 0% chance that we are living in a simulation.
          <ul><li>(Which also means that about half think there is a non-zero chance (!))</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li>A strong contingent (<b>10%</b>) of the respondents think that we are absolutely not living in a simulation <b>and</b> that it is also <i>impossible</i> for a simulation to precisely and accurately model reality.</li>
        <li>Only <b>1</b> person is absolutely certain that we are living in a simulation. Their definition: "Our current reality."</li>
        <li>More analysis of the respondents' definitions of 'simulation' forthcoming...</li>
      </ul>
